# MEANish Stack Tutorial

Reddit/HackerNews clone created to learn MEAN stack.

Created by following the tutorial [here](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial/)

### Notes

- Tutorial uses Angular 1, not 2. This choice is deliberate due to needing to learn Angular 1 for work
- Not yet sure if ES6 syntax will cause issues, so far `'use strict'` and `const` haven't broken anything

### Problems

- [ ] switching to use angular services broke the app due to chrome's CORS issues when loading local files. The tutorial did not indicate that any kind of local server was being used, will investigate resolving the issue.
