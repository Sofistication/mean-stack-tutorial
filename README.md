# MEANish Stack Tutorial

Reddit/HackerNews clone created to learn MEAN stack.

Created by following the tutorial [here](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial/)

### Notes

- Tutorial uses Angular 1, not 2. This choice is deliberate due to needing to learn Angular 1 for work
- Not yet sure if ES6 syntax will cause issues, so far `'use strict'` and `const` haven't broken anything
